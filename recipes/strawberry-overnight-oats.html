  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>These strawberry overnight oats are so easy to meal prep and taste like strawberry shortcake! It’s like having dessert
  for breakfast.</p>
  <p>Combine the strawberry and cake flavors with the creaminess of almond milk and Greek yogurt and you’ve got yourself a
  bowl of oats that tastes pretty similar to strawberry shortcake, yet still healthy enough to serve for breakfast! Plus
  it’s gluten-free, portable and perfect for warm mornings when hot oats aren’t appealing.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Old-fashioned rolled oats - 1 cup</li>
    <li>Unsweetened almond milk - 1 cup</li>
    <li>Greek yogurt - 1/2 cup</li>
    <li>Chopped Strawberries - 1 cup + a bit more for serving</li>
    <li>Chia seeds - 2 teaspoons</li>
    <li>Maple syrup - 1 teaspoon</li>
    <li>Sea salt - 1 pinch</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Place all ingredients in a container and stir until well combined. Seal with a lid and place in the fridge overnight (or
    at least a couple hours).</li>
    <li>Bring out of the fridge in the morning and stir. You’ll notice that the oats soak up a lot of the liquid so you may want
    to add a little more almond milk before serving. Top oats with additional chopped strawberries and serve.</li>
    <li>Enjoy! Overnight oats can keep for up to 5 days in the fridge in a sealed container.</li>
  </ol>
